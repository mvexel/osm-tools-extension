## Full Description

### What is OSM Tools Quick Access?

OSM Tools Quick Access is a lightweight browser extension for OpenStreetMap (OSM) contributors and users that provides one-click access to alternative viewing and editing tools when you're looking at OSM coordinates or changesets.

### Key Features

- **Coordinate-based Tools**: When viewing a page with OSM coordinates (format: map=zoom/lat/lon), instantly access alternative map viewers and editors
- **Changeset Inspection**: When viewing an OSM changeset, quickly open it in various changeset analysis tools like OSMCha, Achavi, and more
- **Customizable**: Add, remove, or reorder tools to match your workflow
- **Lightweight**: Minimal permissions, no data collection, and fast performance

### How It Works

When you visit a page containing OSM coordinates or a changeset link, simply click the extension icon in your browser toolbar. A popup will display relevant tools for the current context, allowing you to open the same location or changeset in your preferred alternative tools with a single click.

### For Mappers

If you're an active OpenStreetMap contributor, this extension streamlines your workflow by eliminating the need to manually copy coordinates or changeset IDs when switching between different OSM tools.

### For Developers and Data Users

Quickly compare how different tools render the same location or analyze changesets with specialized tools to better understand map changes.

### Privacy

This extension respects your privacy:
- No data collection or tracking
- Only uses local browser storage for your tool preferences
- Minimal permissions (only activeTab and storage)

### Open Source

OSM Tools Quick Access is fully open source. Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome on GitHub.
