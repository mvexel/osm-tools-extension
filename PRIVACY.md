# Privacy Policy for OSM Tools Quick Access

*Last updated: March 30, 2025*

## Overview

OSM Tools Quick Access is a browser extension that provides quick access to various OpenStreetMap (OSM) tools when viewing OSM coordinates or changesets. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Storage

**OSM Tools Quick Access does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers for data collection or analytics purposes.

## Local Browser Storage

The extension uses your browser's local storage capabilities (`chrome.storage.sync` API) to save your preferences, such as:

- Which tools you have enabled or disabled
- The order in which tools appear in the menu
- Any custom tools you have added

This information is stored locally in your browser and, if you're signed into your browser account, may sync across your devices. This data is:

- Not accessible to the extension developer
- Not shared with any third parties
- Not used for tracking or analytics
- Entirely under your control and can be cleared through your browser settings

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To detect when you're viewing OSM coordinates or changesets
- **storage**: To save your tool preferences locally

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for collecting any personal information.
